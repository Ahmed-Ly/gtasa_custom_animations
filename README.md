# gtasa_custom_animations
Custom animations support for GTA SA. This code is soon going to be implemented into MTA. It works fine, no more crashes in debug mode.

# IFP support

GTA VC animations work fine in GTA SA, but that's not the case with GTA III, because there are no bones in GTA III, only meshes.
